EKF-SLAM for Mobile Robot Localization (Mini-Project)This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The project estimates a mobile robot's pose while constructing a map of seven static landmarks in a 2D environment.📌 Project OverviewThe simulation models a robot moving in a circular trajectory with a constant linear velocity $v = 1.0$ m/s and angular velocity $\omega = 0.08$ rad/s1111. The system uses range-bearing sensor measurements to detect landmarks and correct the robot's pose estimation2.+2Key FeaturesAugmented State Vector: Jointly tracks the robot pose $(x, y, \theta)$ and the Cartesian coordinates of $N$ landmarks3.Nonlinear Modeling: Implements first-order Taylor expansion (Jacobian matrices $G_t$ and $H_t^i$) to linearize the motion and measurement models4444.+1Uncertainty Visualization: Generates 95% confidence covariance ellipses that visibly "shrink" as landmarks are repeatedly observed5555.+1Robust Correction: Uses atan2(sin, cos) for bearing normalization to prevent angular drift during the update phase6666.+2🛠 MethodologyThe EKF follows a recursive process as described in the course modules777:+1Prediction: Propagates the previous state estimate using a discrete-time Euler integration model8888.+1Correction: Updates the predicted state and covariance matrix using the Kalman Gain and sensor innovations9999.+1Landmark Initialization: New landmarks are added to the state vector upon their first observation using the current robot pose10101010.+1📊 ResultsThe filter maintains high stability and accuracy over the 750-step simulation11111111:+2Trajectory: The estimated path (blue dashed line) stays closely aligned with the ground truth (green solid line)12.Errors: Pose estimation errors remain bounded within $\pm 1.2$ m for position and $\pm 0.1$ rad for heading13131313.+1Consistency: True landmarks consistently remain within the 95% confidence ellipses, proving statistical accuracy14.🚀 Getting StartedEnsure you have MATLAB installed.Clone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/Pasindu-Nimsara-2002/Extended-Kalman-Filter-for-Mobile-Robot-Localization---Mini-Project.git
